<p style="color:#E3F2FD; font-family:Candara; font-size:200%; text-align:center;"> 

This school year has been a surprise for me. For the past few years, I've had the ICT subject out of my mind. It was just like any ordinary subject. But this year was different. I learnt so much more, and it was actually genuinely fun to code (for the most part). I loved the lessons that Ms. Uminga taught us. Huge shoutout to Ms. Uminga, it was acutally much more enjoyable to learn because of her humor, and her ppts. I had friends who also enjoyed coding and also some that didn't but I had helped them whenever they needed it. The first quarter is usually the hardest, so there's more experiences and learning to do.  <br> <br>

We learnt about the rules for XHTML, and the proper way to use it so that our webpages wouldn't look disorganized. We also had learnt about the new tags such as the list tags, ol and ul. The table tag so that we can create tables, a combination of rows and columns. Moreover, we went over how to link pages using hyperlinks, with the anchor tag. Then the different kinds of form inputs we can use. Textboxes, to radio boxes, to checkboxes. We can use these in our future experiences, when we eventually grow old and obtain professions. Technology is already extremely integrated in our society and our workforce. Implementing our knowledge of coding can really help us in the future, when technology will probably be <b> 100X more powerful </b> than today. <br> <br>

I learnt many things through this year. Met new friends, reacquainted with old ones and worked through hardships. I believe that I can make it through the next few years, with hope in my heart. I want to dedicate this paragraph to my parents, my friends and to Ms. Uminga. Thank you all for supporting me in my journey! Even if I'm always so crazy and can't control my energy for things ;-;. TODAY, is the day, I start my next chapter of my journey. A few honorable mentions before I end my reflection. This wouldn't have been possible without the great assistance of my dearest friends, esp. Emmanuel Sumido! <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> W3Schools website </a>, and myself. Thank you!
